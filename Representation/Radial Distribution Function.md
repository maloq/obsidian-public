The RDF describes how the atomic density varies as a function of distance from a reference atom. It provides information about the probability of finding an atom at a distance rrr from a given reference atom, compared to the probability expected for a completely random distribution at the same density.

 * In a crystalline phase, the RDF will show sharp peaks at specific distances corresponding to the regular spacing between atoms in the crystal lattice.
* In a liquid phase, the RDF will have a first peak corresponding to the nearest neighbors, but subsequent peaks will be much less distinct and will decay more quickly.
* Other structures might be somewhere inbetween
