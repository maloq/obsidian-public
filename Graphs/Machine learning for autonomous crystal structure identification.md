### Key Points:

1. **Methodology**:
    
    - The technique applies nonlinear manifold learning, which is a form of unsupervised learning, to analyze the local environment of particles and infer structural relationships.
    - This method is independent of any prior knowledge about the structures, making it versatile and adaptable to various scenarios.
    - The approach yields detailed and unbiased structural information, crucial for identifying and characterizing crystalline structures.
    - 
2. **Advantages**:
    
    - **No Prior Descriptions Needed**: Unlike conventional methods that require predefined target structures, this method operates without such a priori knowledge.
    - **Handling Noise and Fluctuations**: The technique is robust against thermal fluctuations that can obscure local structural details in traditional methods.
    - **Resolution of Small Domains**: It can accurately resolve the structure of small domains, which is particularly beneficial in computer simulations with limited system sizes.
    - 
3. **Applications**:
    
    - The method was demonstrated on a simulation of colloidal crystallization.
    - It successfully identified structural features that standard techniques often miss, showing its potential for improved material characterization.



**Commonalities with  "Unsupervised topological learning for identification of atomic structures" by Becker et al. (2022):**

- Both methods are designed to identify and classify crystal structures without relying on pre-defined templates or structures.
- Each method focuses on topological features of the local atomic environment to discern structural properties.
