### Problem statement

Objective: To develop a robust machine learning framework that characterizes  
and differentiates local atomic structures, crystalline order, etc in monoatomic  
metals(and other materials?)  
Background: Characterizing local atomic environments in materials is crucial for understanding their properties and behaviors.  
Approach:  
1. Local Representation:  
2. Local Regions Clusterization(Classification)/Simulation Space Segmentaion:  
Generate PDs to summarize the birth and death of topological features  
across different scales.  
3. Next step generation with generative model:  
Goals:  
1. Develop prediction model: Create a method that can robustly analyze  
and characterize local atomic environments and global sturcture at several  
timestep into the future(past)  
2. Develop Generative model: ...  
3. Enhance Understanding of Atomic Structures: Provide new insights into  
the topological nature of local atomic configurations, potentially leading  
to better predictions of material properties
