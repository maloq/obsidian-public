### Problem statement

To develop a machine learning framework that characterizes  
and differentiates local atomic structures, crystalline order, etc in monoatomic  
metals. 


### Goals

1. Develop representation model: Create a representation method that can robustly analyze  
and characterize structure and dynamic for local atomic environments.
2. Develop generative model for 
3. Enhance Understanding of Atomic Structures: Provide new insights into  
the topological nature of local atomic configurations, potentially leading


### Approach

1. Local Representation:  
2. Local Regions Clusterization(Classification)/Simulation Space Segmentaion:  
Generate PDs to summarize the birth and death of topological features  
across different scales.  
3. Next step generation with generative model:

Ideas: 
Use prior crystal structure
