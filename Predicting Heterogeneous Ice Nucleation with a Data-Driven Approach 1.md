Mostly about feature engineering

* Lattice match of the substrate to a low-index face of ice;

* Local tetrahedral ordering of the liquid near the surface, ideally measured with lq3, as well as pre-critical fluctuations (measured as the variability of lq3);

* Density reduction of the liquid near the surface;

* Corrugation of the adsorption energy landscape, with a smooth energy landscape preferred to a rugged one.
