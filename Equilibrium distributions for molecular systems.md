Predicting equilibrium distributions for molecular systems with deep learning

Â Distributional Graphormer (DiG), in an attempt to predict the equilibrium distribution of molecular systems. Inspired by the annealing process in thermodynamics, DiG uses deep neural networks to transform a simple distribution towards the equilibrium distribution, conditioned on a descriptor of a molecular system such as a chemical graph or a protein sequence.
